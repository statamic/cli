## Installing the CLI tool

```
composer global require statamic/cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the `statamic` executable can be located by your system. [Here's how](https://statamic.dev/knowledge-base/adding-to-path).

Once installed, you should be able to run `statamic {command name}` from within any directory.

### GitHub authentication

When you install starter kits, the CLI might present you with a warning that the GitHub API limit is reached. [Generate a Personal acces token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and paste it in the CLI. Composer will save this for future use.

## Updating the CLI tool

```
composer global update statamic/cli
```

Run this command to update the CLI tool to the most recent published version.

## Using the CLI tool

### Installing Statamic

You may create a new Statamic site with the `new` command:

```
statamic new my-site
```

This will present you with a list of supported starter kits to select from.  Upon selection, the latest version will be downloaded and installed into the `my-site` directory.

You may also pass an explicit starter kit repo if you wish to skip the selection prompt:

```
statamic new my-site statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings
```

### Checking Statamic versions

From within an existing Statamic project root directory, you may run the following command to quickly find out which version is being used.

```
statamic version
```

### Updating Statamic

From within an existing Statamic project root directory, you may use the following command to update to the latest version.

```
statamic update
```

This is just syntactic sugar for the `composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies` command.
